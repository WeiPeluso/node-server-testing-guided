# Node Server Testing Guided Project

Guided project for **Node Server Testing** Module.

## Project Setup

-   [ ] fork and clone this repository.
-   [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
-   [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
-   [ ] type `npm run server` to start the API.

Please follow along as the instructor adds automated tests to the API.

## Configure Jest for Node

-   install jest-cli -> `npm i -g knex-cli`
-   `jest --init`
-   pick `node` instead of `jsdom` when given the option.

## Testing Endpoints

-   run the server
-   make a request to the endpoint
-   inspect the response
-   assert that the response content is what we expected

## Testing process

-   function (args) { return value; } ---> invoke the function.
-   Component(props) => UI (as JSX); ---> render the component.
-   Endpoint(request data) => response; -> make a request to the endpoint.

## modified TDD workflow

-   failing test
-   passing test
-   refactor
-   commit
